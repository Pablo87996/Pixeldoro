                <h4>Cookie Policy for Pixeldoro</h4>
                <span>This is the Cookie Policy for Pixeldoro, accessible from URL https://pixeldoro.netlify.app.</span>
                <h5>What Are Cookies</h5>
                <p>As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site uses cookies, which are tiny
                    files that are downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what
                    information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will
                    also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored however this may downgrade or break
                    certain elements of the sites functionality.</p>

                <h5>How We Use Cookies</h5>
                <p>We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately in most cases there are no
                    industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and
                    features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure
                    whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.</p>

                <h5>Disabling Cookies</h5>
                <p>You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser
                    Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and
                    many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain
                    functionality and features of this site. Therefore it is recommended that you do not disable
                    cookies.</p>

                <h5>The Cookies We Set</h5>

                <h5>Third Party Cookies</h5>
                <p>In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. The following section
                    details which third party cookies you might encounter through this site.</p>

                <h5>User's responsibilities</h5>
                <p>The user undertakes the responsibility to make appropriate use of the contents and information
                    offered on the site with enunciative, but not imitative, behaviour:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A) Not to engage in activities that are illegal or contrary to good faith and public order;</li>
                    <li>B) Not to spread propaganda or content of a racist, xenophobic, <a
                            style='color: inherit !important; text-decoration:none !important;'
                            href='https://jogoshoje.io'>ERROR</a> or gambling nature, any type of illegal pornography,
                        terrorist claims or against human rights;</li>
                    <li>C) Do not cause damage to physical systems (hardware) and unattainable (software) of Pixeldoro,
                        its suppliers or third parties, to introduce or disseminate computer viruses or any other

                </ul>

                <h5>More information</h5>
                <p>Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something
                    that you aren't sure whether you need or not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it
                    does interact with one of the features you use on our site.</p>
                <p>This policy is effective as of <strong>28 January 2023 01:23</strong>.</p>
