                <h1>1. Terms</h1>
                <p>By accessing the website at <a href='https://pixeldoro.netlify.app/'>Pixeldoro</a> you are agreeing
                    to be bound by these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are

                    terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site. The materials contained in this website
                    are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.</p>

                <h4>2. Use License</h4>
                <p>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on
                    Pixeldoro's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a
                    licence, not a transfer of title, and under this licence you may not:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
                    <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or
                        non-commercial);</li>
                    <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Pixeldoro website;</li>
                    <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
                    <li>transfer the materials to another person or 'mirror' the materials on any other server.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This licence shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be
                    terminated by Pixeldoro at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the
                    termination of this licence, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in
                    electronic or printed format.</p>

                <h4>3. Disclaimer</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>The materials on Pixeldoro's website are provided on an 'as is' basis. Pixeldoro makes no
                        warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties
                        including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for
                        a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.
                    </li>
                    <li>Further, Pixeldoro does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely
                        results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such
                        materials or on any sites linked to this site.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>4. Limitations</h4>
                <p>In no event shall Pixeldoro or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without
                    limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the
                    use or inability to use the materials on Pixeldoro's website, even if Pixeldoro or a Pixeldoro
                    authorised representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.
                    Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of
                    liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

                <h4>5. Accuracy of materials</h4>
                <p>The materials appearing on Pixeldoro's website could include technical, typographical, or
                    photographic errors. Pixeldoro does not warrant that any of the materials on its website are
                    accurate, complete or current. Pixeldoro may make changes to the materials contained on its website
                    at any time without notice. However Pixeldoro does not make any commitment to update the materials.
                </p>

                <h4>6. Links</h4>
                <p>Pixeldoro has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible for the
                    contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Pixeldoro

                <h5>7. Modifications</h5>
                <p>Pixeldoro may revise these terms of service for its website at any time without notice. By using this
                    website you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.</p>

                <h5>8. Governing Law</h5>
